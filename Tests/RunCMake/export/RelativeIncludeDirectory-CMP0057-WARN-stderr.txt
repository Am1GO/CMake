CMake Warning \(dev\) in CMakeLists.txt:
  Policy CMP0057 is not set: Error on export with bad INCLUDES DESTINATION.
  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0057" for policy details.  Use the cmake_policy
  command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  Target "somelib" is installed with a path relative to the installation
  prefix

    "\${_IMPORT_PREFIX}/include"

  in its INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES property.  The target is part of
  export set "exp" which is installed with an absolute path as its
  DESTINATION.  This mixing of absolute and relative paths creates unusable
  target export files.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
