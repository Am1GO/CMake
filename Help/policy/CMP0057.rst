Error on export with bad INCLUDES DESTINATION.

CMake 3.1 and lower generated unusable files with the
:command:`install(EXPORT)` command if an absolute ``DESTINATION`` was used
with it, and a relative path was passed to the ``INCLUDES DESTINATION`` of a
target in the specified export set.  In such cases, a use of an internal
variable was generated, although the internal variable was unset.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to issue a warning if a the
:command:`install(EXPORT)` command generates such an unusable file.  The
``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to issue an error instead of generating
the file.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.2.
CMake version |release| warns when the policy is not set and uses
``OLD`` behavior.  Use the :command:`cmake_policy` command to set it to
``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.
